.TH TTFFS 4
.SH NAME
ttffs \- serve ttf fonts as Inferno (sub)fonts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ttffs
[
.B -dM
] [
.B -p
.I fontpath
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ttffs
serves
.I TrueType
(ttf) font files
as Inferno (sub)fonts in arbitrary sizes, over 9P2000.
Directory /fonts/ttf is read at startup (or
.I fontpath
set with
.BR -p ),
and all ttf files added to ttffs' index.
New ttf files are automatically indexed when the
.I index
file (described below) is opened.
Each ttf file has an associated
.I ranges
file listing the glyphs available in the ttf file.
If a ttf file does not yet have a ranges file, it is created by ttffs automatically.
.I Ttffs
mounts itself on
.I /mnt/ft
by default.
With
.BR -M ,
9P2000 is served on file descriptor 0 instead.
Option
.B -d
enables debug printing.
.SS Files
The following files are served:
.TP
index
A read-only file returning the available fonts, one line for each font name.
A line consists of two quoted strings, separated by a space.
The first is a cleaned-up version of the name (as found in the ttf file) of the font.
The second field is a font specification as understood by
.IR fontsrv (4).
The font name in the specification is the original name found in the ttf file.
Multiple ttf files may result in a single line, e.g. in the case of a single font face available in multiple styles (regular, italic, bold).
.TP
.IR fontname . style . size .font
When a file of this form is walked to, the ttf file associated with that font specification is opened, parsed and cached for subsequent use.
.I Fontname
is a cleaned-up version of the font name contained in the
.I ttf
file.
.I Style
must be one of
.IR r ,
.IR i ,
.I b 
or
.IR ib .
.I Size
(in pixels) must be a number greater than 1.
.TP
.IR fontname . style . size . index
Subfonts that are referenced by the
.IR .font -files.
.I Index
is a number indicating the glyph range of the subfont.

.SH SEE ALSO

.IR fonts (6).
.SH BUGS
No kerning or subpixel rendering is supported.
Only 8-bit greyscale anti-aliased fonts are served.
.PP
The name
.I ttffs
 is not appropriate, more formats than just ttf could be served: freetype supports more than just ttf.
.PP
Generating ranges.* files is slow.
